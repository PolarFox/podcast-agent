# Johtava Arkkitehti Podcast - Project Overview

This project is a content aggregation and processing pipeline for the Johtava Arkkitehti Podcast. It automates the process of finding relevant articles, summarizing them, and creating draft issues in a GitHub repository for potential podcast topics.

## Core Workflow

1.  **Fetch**: Content is fetched from various RSS and HTTP sources defined in a `sources.yaml` file.
2.  **Process**: The fetched content is normalized, deduplicated, classified into categories (Agile, DevOps, Architecture/Infra, Leadership), and summarized.
3.  **Output**: A formatted GitHub issue is created for each processed article, including a TL;DR summary and team impact points.

## Key Technologies

-   **Language**: Python
-   **Orchestration**: A `main.py` script orchestrates the entire pipeline.
-   **Deployment**: The application is designed to run as a scheduled Kubernetes CronJob.
-   **Task Management**: Project tasks are managed with `task-master-ai` and tracked in `[.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json](mdc:.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json)`.

## Project Structure

-   `src/`: Contains the main Python source code.
-   `config/`: Holds configuration files, including `sources.yaml`.
-   `k8s/`: Contains Kubernetes deployment files, like the CronJob definition.
-   `docs/`: For project documentation.
