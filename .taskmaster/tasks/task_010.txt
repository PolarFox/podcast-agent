# Task ID: 10
# Title: Create Main Agent Orchestration Script
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Build main script that orchestrates the entire pipeline from fetching to GitHub issue creation
# Details:
Create main.py that coordinates: config loading, content fetching, normalization, deduplication, classification, summarization, and GitHub issue creation. Implement proper error handling and logging at each step. Add progress tracking and statistics reporting. Include command-line arguments for dry-run and verbose modes. Handle partial failures gracefully.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for full pipeline, error injection tests, performance tests with multiple sources

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Pipeline Coordination and Integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the main orchestration logic that coordinates all pipeline components in sequence
### Details:
Build main.py with pipeline orchestration class that imports and coordinates: config loading (Task 2), content fetching (Task 3), normalization (Task 4), deduplication (Task 5), classification (Task 6), summarization (Task 7), and GitHub issue creation (Tasks 8-9). Implement sequential execution with proper data flow between components. Create pipeline state management to track progress through each stage.

## 2. Implement Error Handling and Centralized Logging [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Add comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the pipeline execution
### Details:
Implement centralized logging using Python logging module with configurable levels. Add try-catch blocks around each pipeline stage with specific error handling strategies. Create custom exception classes for different failure types (ConfigError, FetchError, ProcessingError, GitHubError). Implement graceful degradation for partial failures - continue processing other sources when one fails. Add structured logging with timestamps, component names, and error details.

## 3. Build Progress Tracking and Statistics Reporting [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement progress tracking and generate execution statistics and reports
### Details:
Create progress tracking system that monitors: sources processed, articles fetched, duplicates found, classifications made, issues created. Implement statistics collection including processing times, success/failure rates, and category distributions. Generate summary report at end of execution with key metrics. Add progress indicators for long-running operations. Store execution history for trend analysis.

## 4. Implement CLI and Configuration Management [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Create command-line interface with arguments for dry-run, verbose modes, and configuration options
### Details:
Use argparse to create CLI with options: --dry-run (simulate without creating issues), --verbose (detailed logging), --config (custom config file path), --sources (custom sources file), --log-level (debug/info/warning/error). Implement configuration validation and loading with environment variable support. Add help text and usage examples. Create configuration override system allowing CLI args to override config file settings.

## 5. Add Graceful Partial Failure Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Implement robust handling of partial failures to ensure pipeline continues processing despite individual source failures
### Details:
Implement failure isolation so that errors in processing one source don't stop processing of other sources. Create failure recovery mechanisms with configurable retry logic for transient errors. Add failure reporting that tracks which sources failed and why. Implement circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures. Ensure final execution report includes both successes and failures with detailed error information.
