# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement RSS and HTTP Content Fetcher
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Build content fetching module to retrieve news from RSS feeds and HTTP sources
# Details:
Use feedparser for RSS feeds and requests for HTTP content. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff. Add timeout handling (30s default). Extract title, description, link, published_date, and content. Handle different RSS formats and HTTP response types. Include User-Agent headers to avoid blocking.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with mock RSS feeds and HTTP responses, integration tests with real sources, error handling tests for timeouts and invalid feeds
