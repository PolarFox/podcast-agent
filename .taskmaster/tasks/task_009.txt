# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement GitHub API Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Build GitHub API client to create draft issues in the repository
# Details:
Use PyGithub library for GitHub API interaction. Implement authentication using Personal Access Token from Kubernetes Secret. Create issues with proper title, body, and labels. Handle API rate limiting and errors gracefully. Add dry-run mode for testing. Log all API interactions for debugging.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with mock GitHub API, integration tests with test repository. Test error handling for API failures and rate limits

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup PyGithub Client with Secret-based Authentication [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize GitHub API client using PyGithub library with Personal Access Token authentication from Kubernetes Secret
### Details:
Install PyGithub library and create GitHubClient class. Implement authentication using Personal Access Token loaded from Kubernetes Secret mounted as environment variable or file. Include connection validation and token scope verification. Handle authentication errors gracefully with informative error messages.

## 2. Implement Issue Creation with Rate Limiting and Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build core functionality to create GitHub issues with proper rate limiting, retry logic, and comprehensive error handling
### Details:
Implement create_issue method that accepts title, body, and labels parameters. Add exponential backoff retry logic for transient failures. Implement rate limiting detection and automatic waiting using GitHub API rate limit headers. Handle common API errors (403, 404, 422) with specific error messages. Include validation for issue content and repository access permissions.

## 3. Add Dry-run Mode and Structured Logging [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Implement dry-run functionality for testing and comprehensive logging for all GitHub API interactions
### Details:
Add dry_run parameter to issue creation methods that simulates API calls without actual execution. Implement structured logging using Python logging module to capture all API requests, responses, rate limit status, and errors. Include request/response timing, payload sizes, and API quota usage. Create log formatters for both development and production environments with appropriate log levels.
