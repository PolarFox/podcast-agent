			"taskTitle": "Create sources.yaml configuration file",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of sources.yaml into: 1) Define YAML schema structure with validation rules, 2) Research high-authority RSS sources for each category (Agile, DevOps, Architecture, Leadership), 3) Compile comprehensive keyword mappings, 4) Validate feed accessibility and authority scoring, 5) Create final configuration file with proper formatting",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity due to research requirements for authoritative sources and need for proper YAML structure design. The 5 subtasks appropriately cover schema design, category-specific source research, and validation steps."

			"taskTitle": "Implement RSS/HTTP article fetching module",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose RSS/HTTP fetching into: 1) Core Article dataclass and configuration loading, 2) RSS feed parsing with error handling for different formats, 3) HTTP article fetching for non-RSS sources, 4) Unified orchestrator for concurrent fetching, 5) Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple protocols (RSS/HTTP), various feed formats, concurrent processing, and robust error handling requirements. The 5 subtasks properly separate concerns between data models, protocol-specific implementations, and orchestration."

		{
			"taskId": 39,
			"taskTitle": "Implement duplicate detection and removal",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break duplicate detection into: 1) Article data model with proper hash/equality methods, 2) Content hash calculation for exact duplicates, 3) Similarity calculation using SequenceMatcher, 4) Main deduplication algorithm combining hash and similarity checks, 5) Configuration and performance optimization features",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to algorithmic challenges in similarity detection, performance considerations with large datasets, and need for configurable thresholds. The 5 subtasks separate data modeling, exact matching, fuzzy matching, algorithm integration, and optimization."

			"taskTitle": "Implement monthly prioritization and grouping system",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure prioritization into: 1) Core priority scoring algorithm with weighted factors, 2) Category balance calculation for diversity, 3) Article similarity detection using keyword overlap, 4) Article grouping algorithm with seed-based clustering, 5) Integration and comprehensive testing of complete system",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to multi-factor scoring algorithms, clustering logic, and need for balanced category representation. The 5 subtasks separate scoring mechanics, balance calculations, similarity detection, clustering implementation, and system integration."

			"taskTitle": "Implement GitHub Issues creation module",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break GitHub integration into: 1) GitHubIssueCreator initialization and configuration setup, 2) Issue title generation from article groups, 3) Structured issue body generation with markdown formatting, 4) Label generation and GitHub API integration, 5) Complete workflow integration with comprehensive error handling",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity involving API integration, markdown formatting, structured content generation, and authentication handling. The 5 subtasks separate configuration, content generation components, API communication, and workflow integration."
